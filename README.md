## Project Overview: Building a Weather App using React.js + TypeScript + Vite

### Project Description

This project is a weather app designed to provide users with weather information based on their input city or country name. It utilizes the OpenWeatherAPI to fetch weather data and displays the results accordingly.

### Features

1. **Search by City or Country Name:**

   - Users can input the name of a city or country.
   - Upon submitting, the app fetches weather data from OpenWeatherAPI using AJAX.
   - If it has an error, it will get error message from OpenWeatherAPI and show it to the user

2. **Display Weather Information:**

   - The app displays weather information such as temperature, humidity, etc., for the specified location.

3. **Search History:**
   - The app keeps track of previously searched locations.
   - Users can view their search history, and they can research or delete a specific search record from their search history
   - Without an API, I have to use localStorage to store search history like a BE server.
